  <li><p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.</p></li>
  <li><p>It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.</p></li>
  <li><p> The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p></li>
  <li><p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years</p></li>
  <li><p>The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion)</p></li>
  <li><p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage"</p></li>
  <li><p> The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p></li>

    <li><p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture.</p></li>
    <li><p>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[19]
    </p></li>
    <li><p>The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides.</p></li>
    <li><p>Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side.</p></li>
    <li><p>This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building</p></li>
    <li><p>Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.[20]</p></li>

      <img src="https://www.agraone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mumtaz-Mahal-Shah-Jahan.jpg">
      <ul>
        <li><p>The Mughal ruler Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal, which is acclaimed as, the ‘symbol of love’, in late 16thcentury. All of us might know the basic story behind the making of the great monument named Taj Mahal, which is now one of the Seven Wonders of the World and also UNESCO recognized world heritage site.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Powerful king made this in memory of his favourite and most beloved wife named Begum Mumtaz Mahal. However, we all are unaware of the truth behind the complete and everlasting love story of the beautiful queen Begum Mumtaz Mahal and the powerful Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.

        </p></li>
        <li><p>As per Shah Jahan, the wife was like a lucky charm for him, as after a few years from his marriage Shah Jahan captivated the throne of Mughal Empire winning over his four brothers and became a rebel emperor of the great throne in the year 1628.
        </p></li>

If legends are to be believed from military camps, to trips, in the country or outside, Begum Mumtaz Mahal used to accompany his beloved husband at each and every place so that they both are inseparable and can even take care of each other in their presence.
            Their thirteen children were the proves of the love and bond they shared. However, all good things start to end one day and the two lovers had no idea one storm was coming close, very close to them.
          </p></li>
            <li><p>Then came the dark phase in the lives of the two lovebirds, when Begum Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to her 14thchild and the proof of the love between them she fell seriously ill and week and could not take the pressure of the bad health.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Later he could collect himself he thought of the promise he made to his dead wife, that when she dies he would make the tomb of her grave so big and amazing that the world would lose a breath looking at the magnificent beauty, here is when he thought to start the work for his dream Taj Mahal.
